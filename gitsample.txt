As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, a.k.a. repo, with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of 
#########network access or a central server. A repo is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide
333333333333333 version control capabilities.[14] Git provides features to synchronize changes between repos that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports
############## synchronizing with repos on remote machines. Although all repos (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repo to hold an 
############ integrated copy.
